# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
My solutions for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course offered at BITS Pilani.

This course offers an introduction to typical data structures used for representing collections of data and the associated relations. The course has a design focus but realization and performance issues will also be emphasized.
